# ML Applications

In this project I experiment with different machine learning pipelines applied to a diverse range of problems.

1. US traffic road accidents - a classification problem involving predicting a severity of a road accident from a number of circumstances.\
2. Bacteria growth rate - a regression problem predicting the number of bacteria and its growth rate based on environment conditions.\
3. News articles topic modelling - an NLP task that is about identifying a number of different topics contained within the dataset of articles.

More details about the implementation, datasets, and results can be found inside the respective Python notebook files.
